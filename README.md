Architect Tracker - displays commodities required, provided and needed when you land at a construction site. Still very basic however.

Install Instructions
1. Create a directory called "Architect Tracker" in the the ED: Marketplace Connector plugins folder.
2. Save the code from "Architect Tracker.py" into a file called "load.py".
3. Start EDMC.

Usage
When you land at a construction site the plugin will (after a few moments) create a file with all the commodities and amounts listed. Click the white button on the EDMC interface and the list will be displayed for you.

Notes
This is still very basic. I will be adding features often so check back here often.
This was created using ChatGPT. It probably took me as long to create as a human could have programmed manually but I have no experience programming in Python or for the EDMC so it is kind of impressive.

Notable Changes

2025/04/12 : Added support for multiple construction sites. Sites are removed when they are completed.

2025/04/19 : Added feature - commodities required for construction are highlighted when a commodity market is opened.
